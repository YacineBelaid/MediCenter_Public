## Nom du projet
Dossier Medical Centralis√©

## Description du projet  
We have designed this web-app in the purpose of offering the inhabitants of Quebec to collect and save their medical information in the form of a file in order to make them accessible through a single exchange channel between health professionals and patients.
We have designed a simple displaying board allowing through the network and any electronic device to access their secure account. This application, which can be exported in software format, allows great flexibility in development while maintaining a quality user experience

Also the infrastructure has been designed with the ability to be scaled to larger use allowing sharding strategies and multi instance deployments
